good afternoon so today in Monday we're seeing a long videotaped lecture by Alan
Kay if you don't know the name Alan Kay you should he's one of the Giants in the
history of modern computing arguably invented every aspect of the modern
computing environment the talk is sort
of touches on a lot of different things so I put up a little road map here is the first half that we're going to see
today is largely about the beginnings of precursors of the modern user interface
designs and then Monday is about human psychology and how relevant it is and
how it's relevant and how it contributes to user interface design footnote in the
very recent past we're starting to see new ideas about UI design having to do
with the increasing importance of mobile telephones so there are more people with
smartphones than there are with you know computers with keyboards so some things
are changing this talk is from nineteen eighty-something eighty five plus or minus one so when in
the talk Alan says something about 20 years ago or 25 years ago
add twenty-two dot okay roll it
today to the dawn of some very important ideas when first was the very first
personal computer you see on the slide here this is a machine called the link
it was designed at Lincoln labs in 1962 by West product and it's my vote for the
first personal computer epic anomaly you see it has a display and a keyboard and
have a funny little thing look like that tapes but we actually originally designed for this machine and one of the
design criteria for this machine was it supposed to be small enough on the desk so the person could see over it so one
of the ideas that this machine should not be intimidating and about 2,000 of these were built in the 60s mostly for
biomedical technicians who didn't have a mainframe - at their disposal and didn't
want to hire programmers to use it we wanted something that they could build static experiments themselves do their
own programming and remarkably a very large number of the original 2000 are
still in use today 25 years later the reason is that among other things nervous systems of animals have them
spit up in those years and so a computer that worked very well back then for doing to our neurological experiments
works very well today something else was happening at Lincoln labs in 1962 and
that was the invention of computer graphics Ivan Sutherlands sketchpad
probably the most significant single thesis ever done remarkable program in
many ways even today as well say if we by looking at this tape
this tape is from the very first movie
from the very first movie of sketchpad taken in the summer of 1962 so this is
25 years old rubber bands you're familiar with but look at what he's doing he's pointing at the edges and
saying I want them to be all mutually perpendicular and sketch they have just figured out how to do this gets better
the first system to ever have a window is actually drawing on a virtual sheet of paper about 1/3 of a mile on the side
again to get something you want these liquid sketches it in roughly and then give the rules like be parallel and
perpendicular and sketchpad figures out and solves the problems here the world
is collinearity so that the dashes lie directly over the guidelines for autumn
sketchpad was able solve very complicated problems in real time
involving both linear and nonlinear systems with constraints so it was the
first non procedural programming system and considerably more powerful in the spreadsheets of today so he's made it
hold on the flange continuously as it was back now he wants to make it rivet
and again we see why it's called sketch pad he just draws a rough shape
uses the center of the crocks water there as the center of the arc and then
points to the edges and says they want these to be mutually perpendicular again
solving that forces the cross prior to changes forces the arc to change which gives you a perfectly symmetrical rivet
Andy shows that how no matter how he distorted when he turns the problem-solver on it will come up with a
symmetrical solution he could have made it more complicated he could have constrained the side lengths to be
ratios of each other or tied to some other drawing in the environment
now another important idea seen here for practically the first time is that
master drawings and instances here's working on a master drawing and what he
has here now is an instance of that the instance can be rotated and scaled and
positioned so it's going to insert the rivet in the hole right away the
sketchpad was the first system in which it was definitely discovered that the
right pen is a very bad input device the blood runs out of your hand in about 20 seconds pleases none in spite of dad has
been reinvented at least 90 times in the last 25 years here's another instance of the rivet
another one and the spray is jumping around like that because this they didn't even really have computer
displays back then the tx2 is putting up every dot by brute force he didn't like
the cloth pieces so he goes to the master drawing makes them transparent growing before we see dynamically that
delivers the instance rivets have felt that change so sketchpad is also the
first object-oriented software sister I want to ask the Ivan Sutherland how
could you possibly have done the first interactive graphics program the person
on procedural programming language the first object-oriented software system
all in one year you think well I didn't know it was hard nothing like this
before and here is showing that every instance that you make of something
every master can create instances so he's making a bunch of copies
I'd like to tell you where you could go to buy a system as good as cash bag but I don't know where because there isn't
anything like it even on the market today 25 years later it was a one-of-a-kind thing it ran on a machine
much larger than the studio that I'm recording the talk on faculty last computer large enough to have its own
roof the United States that mammoth machine had are with four hundred and sixty K bytes executed about four
hundred thousand instructions per second which meant that this machine the supercomputer of 25 years ago for the
balance of size of a 512 K Macintosh what you saw there on the screen could be done on any of the desktop computers
today but nobody is doing it something we should think about just wrong now
moving ahead just a couple of years we see another pioneer Douglas Engelbart the teller would invented the mouse the
black-and-white display and the first person to successfully implement
hypertext something that everybody is talking about today and he did something
else that was almost I've seen even by today's standards he actually went and
studies his users so you would poke around people to offices and see the way people actually worked in offices and
discovered something funny that even after 16 years of schooling but people rooted hunched over their desks the way
they've been talking thank you tremendous failure in American education 16 years of being cockpits at hunched
over death and people would still swoon around the office chair and put their feet up on their desk and so forth an
ankle buyer said well why the heck should we make people hunched over their desk to use their personal computers why
not build something into the in this case the lap board that's built into the arm of the chair computer navigation
equipment gives an example of Engelbart's system as of about 20 years
ago in a live demonstration from San Francisco
and machines away
[Music]
a vision of what this is going to be
like years before all of the rest of us the vision included not just some of the
ideas about how people were going to react and interact with the shade but also that since people aren't natural
born detect we're all really communications junkies in regard realizes any kind of user interface
design must include person-to-person collaboration through the
the very first ideas that they had wasn't just how you organize your
information and forms of in dimensional hypertext but how you could share it how you could do something much more than
electronic mail but be able to do direct contact sharing the information being
able to point being able to talk to each other and being able to see each other we might compare that with a very fragmentary vision of the times a mitral
industry which is just struggling over decades to try and reach the vision that Engelbart had almost in a complete form
as early as 1962 another thing that's interesting if we look at the we set up
here of the mouse in one hand the regular keyboard in the center and a Fivefinger keyboard on left hand we see
clearly it was a very good idea and we may have noticed something that was also a bad idea a very good idea angle bar
realize that you really didn't want to spend most of your time going back and forth between the regular keyboard and
the mouse you have to find the mouse you have to find the keyboard and so forth
Stan tangle Bart wanted to set it up so that you would spend a relatively long period of time in either of those two
ways of doing things you know you'd be typing a paragraph of text or you'd be doing lots of now navigation and fixing
single character errors and stuff so the Fivefinger keyboard working with the
three button Mouse is a way of doing all the things that you could do is the key so you could stay for a very long time
and never touch the regular keyboard and the thing that they missed and these not partially missed it because of the
inaccuracy of the analog mouse was the what we call modulus interaction where
you indicate the object first and then give the command because the mouse is inaccurate what they would do in the
command instead of just hitting something like a word or a character or paragraph and then saying something like
moons or it's going to some drag icon they would have to go and say move
Willard then wait for a mouse click to indicate which word
the program would know how fine to try and interpret the mouse coordinates ago
then after unit picked the object you then had to do a command extent so in
order to move something you had to do four separate actions which is quite inefficient even though we'd already set
up a more inefficient scheme than we use today for actually using the tool kind of an interesting paradox that's sort of
the way now a few years later 1967 time
period this is the first personal computer that I worked on called the Flex machine hit with EDG toe and this
is the picture of it on its own display so by that time we realized that we could build a desktop computer and of
course this was a desktop computer for only very special kinds of desk like those made out of state Wade well over
100 pounds that had two characteristics that were very noticeable one of them were it was a tremendous
talking one little black dual inline packages that hold silicon the Macintosh
has about 50 of them so that makes up a Macintosh back then we were lucky as you
could get eight or sixteen gates in one of these packages and this machine had
about 700 of those and generated enormous amount of heat and had a fan was likened to a 747 kicking off the
other thing that was very noticeable about the machine is that the user-interface tend to repel most of the
people that we tried it up I was a designer that interface and I was really crestfallen that people regarded
somewhat the way he would is he listed the lid on the garbage can and saw something moist and fuzzy down very
puzzled how could we put all his work in the machine had a very powerful interactive object-oriented language
that I had derived from stimula graphic very high quality graphics Beckett had
one of the very first yeah it's called the clipping divider done at the same time as Ivan
Sutherlands end in Harvard and then brought later brought out to Utah had a
very large virtual screen that you could map on to the physical screen had
multiple windowing not overlapping window in physics because it was a calligraphic display lots of good stuff
and yet it didn't fly with people that we tried it with and one of the insights
as to why this was and what to do about it came from early contact in 1968 with
seymour papert's logo work have fit school in the whole idea of children
being able to program on the rights that up to now had been in what's called the glass house and industry that big wrong
with air conditioning and raised floor and so forth the whole idea that this could be expanded down into the world with a
child just changed my whole conception about what it was I went from thinking
of it as mid end of art as some sort of super vehicle something akin to a collar
as compared to IBM's Pennsylvania Railroad when from thinking of it says
that to something much simpler I thought of it now as media because cars with
hosting children until they're 18 no I don't know why it's when they're most dangerous but we still nonetheless think
of waiting in color 18 media we never think that way paper and pencil we want
children to start using from the time they can grab the crane and so this works at Patrick's was critical in our
understanding
something was going on at Lincoln labs was the first iconic program who's been
at RAND Corporation people who did the wonderful interactive programming language jobs was done for economists
and other non computer specialists at random had to compute one of their
complaints about really their only complaint about jobs was is that hey none of us can type can you do something
about that so that led to the invention of the first data tablets called ran
tablet back then and this system from about 1968
here's window control came from literally it looks like the thing that
you want so you want to scrub something out and close it out to just draw a box
recognizes he wants one makes one the same slide chop off the corner you want
characters you just make characters and recognizes those or no menus could be always looking directly at grady working
and those who missed the end at the end of sub scan there he hesitated the
world's first mobile system able to just go and change it without issuing anymore
when I saw that myself and used it for a half an hour in 1968 I felt like I was
sticking my hands right through the display and actually touching the information structures directly those
are the first system I'd ever use and practically the only one since that I call truly intimate there was this
degree of intimacy there so important in the user interface I used to show this movie to my group at Xerox PARC
every three months or so so we wouldn't forget
in 1968 was tiny one inch square first flat panel display done at the
University of Illinois we realize it was only going to be a matter of years until you put all of the electronics that we
had on the Flex machine on the back of a flat panel display you have something like this which I later came to call the
Dynabook back in 1968 when I made this cardboard model I just thought of it as
the machine of the future and started thinking about what would it be like for millions of people to have one of these
machines and so the metaphor became the
pencil what would it be like to have something like this as extant in the
world as pencil and paper could people actually use it the answer in 1968 and
the early 1970s was that were so one of the ways that accelerate thinking about answering the question is since we
failed at designing for adults I remembered a wonderful phrase of
Marshall McLuhan he said me I don't know who discovered water but it wasn't a
fish the idea is if you're at worst in a context you can't even see it so we decided to follow Seymour Packers
lead and instead of trying to diet designed for adults we would try and see what this Dynabook of the future would
be like for children and then maybe hope that some of it might spill over into the adult world
so children were an absolute critical factor here and the first stuff I did in
my notebook in 1970 was called Kenny Tom and here is where the first looked like
gonna be built out of a sony tummy china tron
then Xerox PARC came along with an wonderful almost open charter funding
and a very interesting culture these are the bean bags that were so famous at
Parc and one of the reasons we use them we discovered that it was impossible to leap to your feet the devout somebody once you've had in the beanbag chair
because we tended to sink into it further and further so it had a way of relaxing people I was very good for
design then we started experimenting so we built this machine which was a very
very high-resolution way of displaying video images and the first fruits of
that was this font editor the first Bond editor done by Ben laws and all of a
sudden we could get images like this that it was quite possible to mimic high
quality printing images on a display we got very interested in that trying some
of these ideas out on children we discovered they didn't always right there zoom in on that they didn't always
like to have their rough drafts look like they've been printed by the New York Times so some of the children said
well what we really would like to have to rust your ass and that was a way of
instantly telling when we looked at a document just how finished it was intended to be and the Baths display
also allowed us to do sketching and drawing as well as Chris computer
graphics again one of the things that had not been possible before is doing real design on a computer before people
always design them back to the envelope and brought to the back to the envelope to the computer as a way to render it
but here's what we hope for is people that actually stay with the computer for the better part of the day we put a lot
of effort into making this display six or seven hours without hyster next
called any calm this is the summer of 1971
direction
and then we also did some dynamic animations which they admitted space war
has a very important part in the design of things because it was a conceptually
simple precursor of all the video games we known today it should be something that a child could write for himself we
started working on small talk in object-oriented language based on similar but also with a lot of look back
to what sketchpad then all of this led to the alto computer there's mostly by
Chuck Packard at Xerox PARC the first workstation and read through all the
subsequent workstations that also led directly to the visa and the Macintosh Apple we used a group version of
Engelbart's Mouse and it's early stages we call it the interim Dynabook
we brought lots of children in the park to work on these machines and then we took the machines down into the Palo
Alto school working with several hundred children in all here we are Jordan Junior High School around 1976 I
will take a look at animated versions of some of things that ran on this machine
and some of the things that the children get so here's the famous Dynabook model
and back then we wanted it to be like they killed packard calculator except to
be a real live computer this is the inspiration for all that we are thinking
about is what it was going to be like he has been laws fond editor he used to
make it a and Lydian cursive
most of these are taken
here's the painting program I designed in the summer of 1972 and Steve Purcell
implemented it here you see some and character recognition recognize the
letter C for the command for drawing circles that was put in by John shock
we're experimenting with this time here's a nail for drawing lines well I
think about hand character recognition is that you don't have to move very far to hit them here's a date for drawing
wires of the mating program I think you can see it has most of the features
the idea of actually being able to fashion your brushes right in the
combination of canvas and palette itself something that Rafael taught us I think
the idea of having charcoal airbrush
effects putting in specular reflections
here's an example making a little brush a bunch of different dots take it
here's some experiments of the very first experiments with windows dragging
them around by one corner opening their size of the other corner just like on the bank today making another one by
going up to the upper right-hand corner typing something in it
clipping the stuff that's inside this is the very first actual test
of course we new windows are going to work
here is one of the very first group of kids I can tell that because they aren't even display covers on the display we
had put in old cardboard boxes keep the kids from getting electrocuted
I think sixth graders fifth or sixth graders this is Adele Goldberg who later
went on to head the group after I left park and she was responsible for many of
the ideas teaching the children we first did rugged like things in small talk
this program we also experimented with with animated windows here's been very
first test of an animated window which we later abandoned because the machine was instead of getting a just an open
frame that actually
is actually very powerful computer that you could get to its microcode directly
we could and the also is able to animate about 120 square inches of graphics and
multiple claims but he could do very complex two-and-a-half the animation
effects this is something done by press tell I think around the end of 1973 that
was really the machine we thought we had the machine you could animate everything on it
tying all that stuff together with small cog who got a number of interesting
things with the kids here is one of the second this is a 13 year old teaching 12
year olds Marion had done one of the very first tools in small talk the year before when she had learned it and she
was a very outgoing young children
this is from 1975 Cogan looks very much
like that draw it's an object-oriented graphics illustrator you can select by
means of selection handles
their feedback is coming in the window
in the center the only thing that's really interesting about those programs
resides that it was done in 1975 which is before you could buy an in the store it was actually conceived designed and
implemented by a twelve-year-old girl after only a few months of program and swallow it took her about two weeks to
do this and the size of the program in small talk 72 was about a page long part
of our aim here was not just to get people vehicle access but also to be
able to do the equivalent of writing short essay and having them have great effect one of the things that is
disturbing when they true about most novices on computers here is that about
two pages of program like to be able to spread it out use their visual field as
an extension of their short-term memory there's another example a 15 year old
boy again after a few months of programming in small 572 he was
interested in ham radio but really had gotten bored with the tedium of drawing
radio diagram so he decided to make himself a ham radio illustrator it has
some quite sophisticated features you see here a pop up menu with often used
things like opening for his dogs and he has a more extensive menu of iconic
shapes for the circus
the battery symbol was rotated and put it in this and also that in 1975 and one
of my favorite programs done by a child because less than ten years before this a PhD had been awarded for system
equipment was good this program is about 80
next we have a program done by adults
but for the most part who had never programmed before they were professional animators that gave the park in the
summer of 74 and the animators would like to do is to see whether their
animator animation is going to work before they have to go to film so that summer they devised a variety of systems
and really what every animator would like to do is draw a picture reach over
into the movie window grab the thing and just drawn show it what to do have it
playback
and when it gets down to the bottom here what he's going to do is replace that with a fresh drawing that's going to
come from another transparent cell over ways in the drawing windows on the right
hand side so the drawing windows can have several transparent or overlaid each other the use of the old one for
registration purposes so it's now drawing on another cell and that drawing
will be inserted into the animation as the animation goes and now the animator
can speak how much detail he has to put into that squash drawing before we see
it as actually squashing a tea he obviously has to at least put in the specular reflection
rather than children can actually do but here's a twelve-year-old girl that was
very interested in horses and so she spent some time getting the
correct gait and animating a horse across the screen but then she wanted to
feature that the adult animators hadn't put in and that was to be able to combine two animations into a single one
so she has the forced animation going over there and here she has a jocular animation and
she wants to be able to pick it up and in the act of actually combining she
wants to valid fuse into one drop this is a feature that she was able to put in her settle because even though she
wasn't capable of writing a 5 page program like the adult she was quite capable of reading it in making a change
in it and here's the finished animation
and what we've just seen are some things that are familiar to us now in this day
of the microcomputer we've also seen some things and people aren't yet doing people don't usually sit down and do for
themselves a complete tool like an illustrator they go to the store and spend several hundreds of dollars and
yet here we see twelve-year-old children coming up with the idea and being able to implement it and not only being able
to implement it but being able to implement it in a very compact why is that and why is this such an important
part of computer literacy I think literacy has three important parts to it there's an access part and
in print meeting we call that reading somebody else makes up the material we have the skills to penetrate that
material and understand it access literacy second one is creative
glue we don't think the person is literate if all they can do is read we think they should be able to write and
the English language is powerful enough in its in its metaphor that we can do
very strong expressions of our own intent in district 8 or to start the
revolution with two pages of all Castro's programming languages just haven't been strong enough and easily
enough to understand because wherever to have computer literacy it is going to have to have those two things first
order attributes and then the third thing in computer we are seeing is that
for anything that we can be literate in there in the literature so when we read
Shakespeare we have to read Shakespeare with a completely different approach to the genre of the Elizabethan age than we
do from reading the instalay so throughout the many centuries in which the English language has existed there
are different genre that we have to be able to adapt to
yeah it's great [Applause]
next time we'll see the part about psychology and how it affects design by
the way that the Engelbart demo that you saw and sketch CAD had like 50th
anniversary parties a year ago or so so that's how old that stuff is and when
Allen says I'd like to tell you where to buy something that's good you still can't so we'll talk a little
bit about why that is - Felix Monday
