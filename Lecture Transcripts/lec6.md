afternoon today we're going to see the second half of Alan Kay the part about
how your brain works and why that matters I think I may have said this on
Friday but let me remind you all of your lives there's been a standard for a user
interface that you all take for granted so there are these windows and and up at
the top of the window there's a menu bar and you have a mouse or something to
point with and there are these icons and double clicking means to do it and stuff
like that in every application on every operating system pretty much control s
me and save a ctrl C means copy and all of those things it's pretty amazing
actually that there is a standards like that and what's more amazing is that
there are reasons for some of the details of how that worked out and so that's what we're going to learn about
today thank you

okay um okay so uh there are two little details first of all that I want to
point out that may have whizzed by you too fast one of them is in the paint
program that you saw today he when he was talking about the radio buttons that
you can control what that means is that you can add to the user interface you
can make new controls that are clickable by writing little chunks of small talk
code so behind every button you click on there's a program and those programs are
visible to you and you can add your own so there's a kind of a balance between
programming the system and sort of using it by pointing and clicking and all that
and the other thing is like back on Friday something about the second or
third sentence of the talk which I'm sure was by too fast is that the goal of
user interface is to make a system that everybody can use without losing any of
the capabilities of the machine so it's really easy to make a user interface that does three things you know by
having three buttons and you push them and that's fat but the challenge is to
make a system that lets you do anything and in pursuit of that idea I want to
show you these graphs this is my two
cents on user interface design and you
may be wondering what these are graphs of so I'll label the axes this is task
complexity so how difficult is the thing you're
trying to accomplish and the y-axis is
wizard leanest so how much of a wizard
do you have to be in order to get that task done and this first graph is the
graph of sort of pre Alan Kay Xerox PARC that whole movement systems like UNIX
and my thought in which you can't add
two and two as Alan was saying without reading the manual and and figuring out about what to type at the prompt and
command-line arguments and just all that stuff there's a whole lot of mechanism
before you can do anything once you've learned that you can do a bunch of stuff
more more complicated and the system will respond to you and then as you want
to do things that aren't already anticipated because you have this level
of expertise to begin with you can sort of add to it gracefully that you know
you can write a shell script or a batch
job in Doss that does a little thing and then you can start writing little
programs and and you can do macro languages and your editor and stuff like
that you can learn skills more and more to do the more complicated things so
that's the traditional computer system and then this picture is
Mac OS before OS 10 and it's don't even
want to write it in these systems the
genius of those systems is that there's an awful lot of stuff that you can do
hardly knowing anything about computers anybody can walk up to the computer and just start doing which is the lesson
that Alan Kay was getting from tipping always tennis stuff that you just do and
then what happens all of these things are the things that somebody anticipated you wanting to do and then what happens
is that you hit the wall and you have to read twenty three volumes of inside
McIntosh in order to take the next step
those of you who are Windows users sort of know about this those of you who are Mac users might not because something
changed but if you look at these two graphs it seems obvious to me that what
you really want is a kind of merging of these so that you start with a low level
of wizardly notes as in the Mac but then what you have to know in order to do
harder tasks grows gradually instead of having that huge jump and this is kind
of the holy grail of user interface design because it does the thing that
that I mentioned in that sentence from the beginning of the talk where you make
it so that ordinary people can use the computer but you don't lose any of the
capabilities of the raw machine you can you know as you get more and more skills you can do anything that the computer
can do has this ever been achieved yes
twice one is their Xerox Alto which you saw a
lot of in the video and the other one was the MIT lift machine that was kind
of the same idea except done and Lisp instead of a small talk and both of
these systems you could walk up to it and start using it but there's nothing that you couldn't do as you grew more
and more expert Mac os10 is a pretty
good attempt at regaining this and these systems we're done you know in the 1970s
right and not in your lifetime and there hasn't really been anything in your
lifetime they can quite do this Mac OS 10 for those of you who are not Macintosh users it's really UNIX
keep down inside and they layered on top of that something that looks like the
traditional Mac OS interface so that's
pretty good because you can start out simple and then when there's something
you want to do that the Mac user interface doesn't do you can open a shell window like in the machines in the
lab and start typing in Unix commands the trouble is that those two ways of
working aren't very well integrated yet it's getting better over time but it's
not really smooth getting from the Mac like work to the UNIX like work
nevertheless it's the thing that I have at home because I can do simple things
simply you know it can listen to iTunes and everything but also I feel like I
have a powerful computer that I can talk to so those of you who are interested in
user interface I would like you to try to build systems like this that not only
are simple to use but let you do everything in a nice way okay see you
